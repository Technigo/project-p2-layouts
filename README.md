# Website for an illustration-collective

I'm building a little website for  a collective of illustrators called "salamihochdrei".
It contains a landing page, a page each for works, contact and about, and in the future I'd like to add in a web-shop.

## The problem / main focus

My main focus was on making this website responsive and nice to use on mobile, tablet and desktop. It's far from finished (the about and contact site aren't even styled), but I've learned a lot with flexbox, the card layout and the media queries, and will continue building this website to eventually also put it online :)
