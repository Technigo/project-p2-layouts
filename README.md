# Project Simone Steiger

I wanted to create a portfolio site for my friend, with all the different talents she has to offer.

## The problem

My main problem was to make all the galleries of the subsites to behave similarly in the different media queries.
Also I wasn't quite able to make the footer to always stick to the end of the page, especially when there is not so much content. 

## View it live

Have you deployed your project somewhere? Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
