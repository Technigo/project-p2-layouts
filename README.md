# Project Name

For this project I set up a webpage using flexbox and made it responsive to work on different screen sizes.

## The problem

I set up a main page with a classic flexbox layout, spaced evenly. Additionally I created subpages where I also used flexbox.
The main page as well as the sub page were then made responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop.
If I had more time, I would add a menu which would collapse to a hamburger menu on mobile, but this did not make sense for the content on the current page.
