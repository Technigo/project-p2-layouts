# The Cat Working Space

The project is about a fictional Co Working Space - with cats. And coffee, of course. 

## The problem

I didn't get to costumize the style of the footer. I got it centered, but I do not understand, why the thing with the text decoration did not work. 

Also want to know, if there is a better solution than to call the 

.first-container .container like this. I adapted the style from the code-along-video. But it confused me. How can i rename it to understand it better - me and others?
